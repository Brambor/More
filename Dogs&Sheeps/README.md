# Dogs-and-Sheeps
This is a little simulation created to learn class in python. I will improve it over time.

Features:Dogs hounting Sheeps, killing them and eating their Corpses. Sheeps searching for Grass and eating it. Grass that grows.
Easy way to change map dimensions and FPS.
And badass old film look!

Ideas: Graphic, rocks (these are on the way!), better searching for target (working on too), reproduction, dying of old age, zombie sheeps (not sure), tourists, Bacas, ghosts, water, and more!
